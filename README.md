A Pseudo-modified Code: Typing.js 

Type the words displayed.
Click 'Start' to begin.
Bugs exist in the game.

i) Intention is to cause the 'Overbrush' colour that runs through each letter when the right letter is typed, to respond appropriately (blink for signaling the right letters to be displaying itself different).

ii) Other intention is to cause the .TXT file to be the external source of array, instead of writing them all in the body of .js file.

*Sample: PE(R)AMBULATO(R).


*Letter (R) shows itself in RED COLOUR.
Other letters maintained in the same default colouration, when correctly typed.

Elements and concepts involved:

i) Variables. As the foundation of any computer programming language, variables act as “containers” that “hold” information. ...
ii) Data Structures: Words stored in array, within code.
iii) Control Structures: For-loop and function calls
iv) Syntax: appropriate syntax and library references
v) Tools: VS Code, Source code, javascript, css, html
